# mlflow with basic auth

**UPDATE: Standard mlflow supports authentication since 2023.**
Consider using that instead of this project.
See the official documentation at https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/auth/index.html

## This project

[mlflow](https://mlflow.org/) before version 2.5.0 (July 2023) did have any authentication for the web-interface.
This project adds basic HTTP authentication with a **single username, password** to the web interface and API.
And packages this up in a easy-to-install Docker image.

The simplest configuration uses just a Docker volume for persistence.
Alternatively one can configure Google Cloud Storage as the artifact store,
and Heroku Postgres as the tracking store.

It should be easy to deploy to most Docker providers,
such as Dokku, Fly.io, Heroku, Amazon ECS, Docker Cloud Run, DigitalOcean App Platform, et.c.

Pull requests are welcome to fix compatibility issues.

## License

# Quickstart

## Run with Docker

Clone this git repo

```
git clone https://github.com/soundsensing/mlflow-easyauth.git
cd mlflow-easyauth
```

Build the image

```
docker build -t mlflow-easyauth:latest .

```

Create a .env file with settings

```bash
cat <<EOT >> settings.env
MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME=user
MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD=pass
#GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON=None
#ARTIFACT_URL=mlruns
#DATABASE_URL=mlruns
EOT
"
```

Create a Docker volume for persistence

```
docker volume create my-mlflow-server-volume
```

Run it

```
docker run -d \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 10101:6000 \
  --mount source=my-mlflow-server-volume,target=/mlruns \
  --env-file=settings.env \
  --name mlflow-server \
  mlflow-easyauth:latest
```

## How to use mlflow in python (mlflow client)

Configure .env file
```
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=
MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME=
MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD=
```

Run some code using the mlflow tracking API.
```python
import dotenv
import mlflow

dotenv.load_dotenv()
mlflow.set_experiment("your-experiment-name")

...

```
Open mlflow UI on your browser to view the runs.

```
{MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI} 
```

# Configuration options

All configuration is done as environment variables.
Set them using the preferred method for your Docker host.

## Using PostgreSQL for metrics persistence

Setup PostgeSQL in your preferred way.

Configure the host and credentials using `DATABASE_URL`
```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:port/path
```

## Using Google Cloud Storage for artifact persistence

Using [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/).

Create a new or find an existing Google Cloud Storage bucket.

Create a Service Account for API credentials. Download the credentials JSON file.

Add the Service Account to Permissions on the bucket.
It needs to have the following roles:
```
Storage Legacy Bucket Writer
Legacy Bucket Reader
Legacy Object Reader
```

Modify configuration to

```
ARTIFACT_URL=gs://MY-BUCKET/SOME/FOLDER
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON="`cat serviceaccount-fa31bc1bbb1d.json`"
```

# Developing

This command re-runs all the steps needed to build and run a new version.
It is useful when iterating on the Docker files.

```
docker build -t mlflow-easytracking:latest . && docker run -it -p 8001:6000  --env-file=`pwd`/dev.env    mlflow-easytracking:latest bash /app/entry-point.sh
```
